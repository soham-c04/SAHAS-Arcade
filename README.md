# SAHAS-Arcade
This repository contains a group developed using C,C++ and library graphics.h

It contains 5 games
- Air_Hockey, Snake, 2048 (SAHASArcade [.exe/.cpp] )
- Soccer Stars (Soccer_stars_combined [.exe/.cpp] )
- Moving Ball (development [.exe/.cpp] )

And a variation of the Soccer_stars game which is the "Windows Screen Saver.exe" which resembles the Bubbles screen saver in Windows.

.exe files are attached so as to allow them to play the game without having to install devC++ and graphics.h on their device.

-- THE END--
